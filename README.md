# 🛠️ Getting Started:

To use the `awesome_notifications_core` plugin to manage all of your awesome notifications plugin versions, follow these steps:

1. Add the `awesome_notifications_core` plugin to your project's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  awesome_notifications_core: ^0.7.5 // latest
```

2. Add all of the other awesome notifications plugins that you want to use in your project, with the version value set to `any`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  awesome_notifications_core: ^0.7.5
  awesome_notifications: any
  awesome_notifications_fcm: any // <- The other plugins are optional
```

## Tips

* You only need to add the awesome_notifications plugins that you need to use. The only packages required are `awesome_notifications` and `awesome_notifications_core`.
* The `^` operator in the version constraints tells Flutter to install the latest version of the package that is compatible with the specified major version.
* By setting the version constraints for your awesome notifications plugins to `any`, you are allowing the `awesome_notifications_core` plugin to automatically manage the versions of those plugins and ensure that they are always compatible with each other.
